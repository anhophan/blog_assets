# FedCM support for IBM Security Verify Access

I've recently started taking a look at Google's proposed [Federated Credential Management API](https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/3pcd/fedcm) also known as FedCM.

You can read all about the API, who may want to use it, and why on the Google website, or in the [FedCM Github Repo](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/).

The purpose of this readme and associated assets is to provide you with a starting point for understanding how to configure IBM Security Verify Access (ISVA) as either an [Identity Provider](idp/README.md) or [Relying Party](rp/README.md) supporting FedCM.

Please take a look at the README and assets in each of the subdirectories for detailed instructions on how to configure ISVA for FedCM.
